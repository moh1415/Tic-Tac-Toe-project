### User Stories
* As a user, I should be able to *start a new tic tac toe game.
* As a user, I should be able to click on a square to add X first and then O, and so on
* As a user, I should be shown a message after each turn for if I win, lose, tie or who's turn it is next
* As a user, I should not be able to click the same square twice
* As a user, I should be shown a message when I win, lose or tie
* As a user, I should not be able to continue playing once I win, lose, or tie
* As a user, I should be able to play the game again without refreshing the page
### Approach taken
Start thinking how can players win or tie and start to create the layout in HTML and design with CSS how the game should look like in page by end start step by step to do logic for the game in all situations.

### Unsolved problems
None


### How you solved for the winner
1. Using a loop to check each box by box using if condition and check if they not empty first then check if their value matches then return the value of one box win to determine which player wins.
###
2. For both center diameter, I use the logical indexes and check if they did not empty then check if they match then return value of box win to determine which player wins.

### Future iterations
* Add an AI opponent.
* Add scores tracking.

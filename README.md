### How you solved for the winner
1. Using a loop to check each box by box using if condition and check if they not empty first then check if their value matches then return the value of one box win to determine which player wins.
###
2. For both center diameter, I use the logical indexes and check if they did not empty then check if they match then return value of box win to determine which player wins.

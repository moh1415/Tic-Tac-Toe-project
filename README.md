### Approach taken
Start thinking how can players win or tie and start to create the layout in HTML and design with CSS how the game should look like in page by end start step by step to do logic for the game in all situations.

### Unsolved problems
None


### How you solved for the winner
1. Using a loop to check each box by box using if condition and check if they not empty first then check if their value matches then return the value of one box win to determine which player wins.
###
2. For both center diameter, I use the logical indexes and check if they did not empty then check if they match then return value of box win to determine which player wins.

### Future iterations
* Add an AI opponent.
* Add scores tracking.
